This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Before run - yarn install or npm install

Runs the app in development mode - yarn start or npm start 
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

I decided to this with React and RxJS. 
I haven't work with React before, but I thought it would be good chance to learn something new.
I didn't have enough time to write unit tests, but it was fun anyway ;)
